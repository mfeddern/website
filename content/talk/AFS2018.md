abstract: After passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, pinniped populations along the west coast of North America experienced exponential population increases following historic lows in the 1970’s. In Puget Sound and coastal Washington, this increase in pinniped abundance corresponded with changes in large scale climate conditions (Pacific Decadal Oscillation; PDO) and depletion of prey species (forage fish, salmon). Increasing pinniped populations have created new challenges for fisheries management, particularly because some of their prey species are commercially important or protected (e.g., salmon, herring) and little is known about the impact pinnipeds have on fish populations or marine food webs. The objective of this research is to quantify long-term changes in harbor seal trophic position to understand how populations of this generalist predator have impacted and responded to changes in prey abundance and primary productivity with changing climate regime.
140 bone specimens collected from ~1940-present were analyzed for 15N/14N of 11 individual amino acids (AAs), including both trophically fractionated (trophic) and trophically conserved (source) amino acids. Animals conserve certain “source” AAs during trophic transfers from prey to predator, and 15N/14N ratios of these “source” AAs reflect the environmental N sources for the organism. Trophic AAs, in contrast, are fractionated with each trophic transfer at a consistent rate per trophic level per amino acid. Trophic and source AA data were used to calculate trophic position and as indicators of primary productivity respectively. Changes in trophic position and productivity over time were compared to changes in indicators of ecosystem condition (prey availability, marine mammal abundance) and environmental condition (sea surface temperature, Pacific decadal oscillation regime shifts) to determine the relationship between harbor seal trophic position and ecosystem dynamics.
