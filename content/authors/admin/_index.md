Megan is a postdoctoral researcher at University of Alaska working on climate drivers of Chinook salmon population dynamics in the Arctive/Yukon/Kuskokwim region. Previoulsy, Megan was a Ph.D candidate  in the  </a> <a href="http://holtgrievelab.uw.edu/"> Holtgrieve Ecosystem Ecology Lab</a> where she earned her degree in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences with a certificate in Data Science through the </a> <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/"> UW eScience Institute</a>. Her dissertation research used compound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids to understand changes in primary productivity and foraging ecology of pinnipeds in the northeast Pacific using museum skull specimens. Her research interests include climate ecology, specifically, how species interactions are influenced by changes in the physical and biogeochemical environment. Megan also values applying data science techniques to ecology and has an expertise in time series analysis and Bayesian statistics.

Megan is originally from the White Mountains of NH and moved to Seattle for graduate school after spending a few field seasons moving around the country and abroad. Outside of research Megan enjoys anything outdoors, particularly new activities that get her outside of her comfort zone and require problem solving. Backpacking, snowboarding, and trail running is how she spends her time outside of the office.
