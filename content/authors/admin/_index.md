Megan is a Ph.D candidate studying Aquatic and Fishery Sciences in the Holtgrieve Ecosystem Ecology Lab. Her research interests include food web dynamics, specifically, how species interactions are influenced by changes in the physical and biogeochemical environment. Megan enjoys harnessing the power of chemical tracers to answer complex ecological questions and her current research uses compound specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids to understand changes in primary productivity and foraging ecology of pinnipeds in the northeast Pacific using museum skull specimens. Megan also values the benefit of applying quantitative tools to ecological data, and has an expertise in time series analysis and Bayesian statistics.

Megan is originally from the White Mountains of NH and moved to Seattle for graduat school after spending a few field seasons all around the country and abroad. Outside of research Megan enjoys anything outdoors, particularly new activities that get her outside of her comfort zone and require problem solving. Backpacking, snowboarding, and trail running is how she spends her time outside of the office.
